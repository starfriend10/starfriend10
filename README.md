### **Latest Updates**
**2025-05** A simple bibliography search could miss many important research even through scientific database, NLP-based comprehensive literature retrieval can significantly improve relevant publication identification. I developed such a method in 2020 and applied it to numerous studies since then, and now I'm happy to share it. Please check [NLP-PubMiner](https://github.com/starfriend10/NLP-PubMiner) and feel free to adapt it to your project!

**2025-01** The long form QA dataset used in [our recent GPT paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00665) is now shared in the GitHub repository [ENVIRONLLMQA](https://github.com/starfriend10/ENVIRONLLMQA). The dataset includes 286 what/how/why QA data focusing on Biological Wastewater Treatment. The repository will also be used to store and share future environmental datasets curated for domain-specific large language model development.

**2024-10** I'm happy to share the EMBRACE Checklist -- **E**nvironmental **M**achine-learning, **B**aseline **R**eporting, **A**nd **C**omprehensive **E**valuation:  [EMBRACE Checklist](https://github.com/starfriend10/EMBRACE). A [viewpoint](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c09611) is published in *Environmental Science & Technology*: "The Checklist aims to offer guidelines for reporting the key information needed for others to refer to the work, and a stepwise guide for preparing and performing impactful environmental ML research. These standards will continue to evolve as the research community expands, and efforts to develop community-based guidelines should persist."

**2023-08** I used Github years ago to store my earlier MATLAB GUI software. I'm sharing Python or other open source code for past or current research work. Python codes for [Metaheuristics](https://github.com/starfriend10/Metaheuristics) (Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)) and [Word2vec modeling](https://github.com/starfriend10/Word2vec) are shared.

**2021**    A special [website](https://starfriend10.github.io/EST/) was designed and shared for interactive browsing data published in the [feature article](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c07551) "ES&T in the 21st century: A data-driven analysis of research topics, interconnections, and trends in the past 20 years".

**2019**    [ISMLR package](https://github.com/starfriend10/ISMLR-package) (and [application](https://github.com/starfriend10/ISMLR-application)) was shared. The open access software was developed to conduct full dataset development and modeling using iterated stepwise multiple linear regression, which provided simutaneously missing data management and feature selection.
